#Projects Projects

This are the programming projects I worked and collaborated with my classmates.

- Maze Project
A programming project assigned for Quinnipiac's Data Structure's and Abstraction Course. This goal of the project is to create a program that can solve very large and complex mazes using a recursive algorithm. This project involves programming a recursive algorithm, implementing an Abstract Data Type (ADT), working with two-dimensional array's, and constants. This project was programed by me and Kevin Rodriguez, a Software Engineering undergrad at Quinnipiac.
