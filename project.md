#Projects

This are the programming projects I worked and collaborated with my classmates.

- [Maze Project:](https://github.com/kevin-rodri/MazeProject)
 This goal of the project is to create a program that can solve very large and complex mazes using a recursive algorithm. This project involves programming a recursive algorithm, implementing an Abstract Data Type (ADT), working with two-dimensional array's, and constants. This project was programed by me, Harsh Gandhi, and Kevin Rodriguez, a Software Engineering undergrad at Quinnipiac.

- [File Traversal:](https://github.com/GandhiHarsh2003/FileTraversal)
This is the project which goes through each item (File/Directory) inside the passed in directory and print out the absolute path of the item. I used recursive algorithms to build this project. If the item is a Directory, it should then go through each item inside that directory and print out the absolute path of the item. This process will keep repeating until every single File in every single Directory has been reached.

- [Assembler:](https://github.com/GandhiHarsh2003/FileTraversal)
 We Created programming project that involved designing a modified basic assembler. This project involves using functions, working with maps, lists, lists of lists, cases, and iteration. Collaborated with Jonathan Varghese and Ohm Patel, both students at Quinnipiac.
