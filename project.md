#Projects

This are some of the projects that I built throughout the freshman year of college. Please click on the specific project link to learn more about them:

- [Maze Project:](https://github.com/GandhiHarsh2003/Maze-Solver)
 This goal of the project is to create a program that can solve very large and complex mazes using a recursive algorithm. This project involves programming a recursive algorithm, implementing an Abstract Data Type (ADT), working with two-dimensional array's, and constants. This project was programed by me, Harsh Gandhi, and Kevin Rodriguez, a Software Engineering undergrad at Quinnipiac.

- [Graphing-And-Grading-System](https://github.com/GandhiHarsh2003/Graphing-And-Grading-System)
Built a program for the teachers to improve the grading system. In this program teachers would be able to keep track of their students test average. They can also compare which students are doing well in the class and which ones are struggling. To make this program, we built two data structures from scratch. We used jmathio.jar and jmathplot.jar Libraries to read in the input data and present the graph according to the data. We also added additional components which let teachers print multiple students average on one graph and see how the overall class is performing on the tests. This project was built by me, Harsh Gandhi, and Kevin Rodriguez.

- [Monster Battle:](https://github.com/GandhiHarsh2003/Monster-Battle)
This program generates battles between two monsters. User can build their own monsters and use the program to generate battles between them or they can use the monsters which are already built in the program. The battle is broken into rounds and continues until at least one monster is dead. After every round: Program prints the round number. It also prints which monster attacked which monster, and prints damage taken by each monster. The program loads the monsters by the text file and every attribute of the monsters are in the text file.

- [Assembler:](https://github.com/GandhiHarsh2003/assembler)
 Develop a simple assembler for a simplified version of the Assembly Language LC-3, which itself is a simplified version of a modern assembly language. Assembly language, is essentially the language of the computer, is often used in control systems. The commands available in an assembly language are very limited but are sufficient to accomplish virtually any task that can be done with higher-order languages, since those are actually translated to the machine language anyway. The task was to interpret a simplified assembly code. This project was built by me, Harsh Gandhi, Jonathan Varghese, and Ohm Patel.

 - [Hackathon 2022:](https://github.com/GandhiHarsh2003/Hackathon-2022)
 This is the java program that was built in the 2022 annual Hackathon of Quinnipiac University. This java program uses the Java Swing library and additional methods to match the theme of the hackathon. This program will inform users of the top three illnesses in the United States. All sources are mentioned in our app. This project was programed by me, Harsh Gandhi, and Kevin Rodriguez, a Software Engineering undergrad at Quinnipiac.

- [File Traversal:](https://github.com/GandhiHarsh2003/FileTraversal)
This is the project which goes through each item (File/Directory) inside the passed directory and print out the absolute path of the item. I used recursive algorithms to build this project. If the item is a Directory, it should then go through each item inside that directory and print out the absolute path of the item. This process will keep repeating until every single File in every single Directory has been reached.
