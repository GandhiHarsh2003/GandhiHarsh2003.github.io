# How does Retargated Advertisement Affect Human Behavior

I chose to research on this topic because I was highly interested in how the advertisement have changed over the years and why companies were shifting their focus from billboards to social media retargated advertisement.
Through my research I found that individuals have held misbeliefs about retargeted advertisement, insisting that it shows users random products from brand websites that they have visited often. This is a lot further from the truth. Retargated advertisement that users see on social media has many factors that users don't know about. Companies are hiring professionals to gain knowledge about how they can get the attention of more  customers and increase their coustomer retention by showing advertisement which will make user visit their website more often.
