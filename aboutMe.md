# About Me

My name is Harsh Gandhi and I am currently a freshman at Quinnipiac University. From an early age I’ve always been deeply interested in computing. It was my dad, introducing me to the computer systems at his work place that first sparked this interest. Computer Science has been my passion since I was a kid but it turned into reality when I came to United States of America at the age of 14.

I still remember sitting in my first programming class, in high school, where i learned how to print "Hello World". Making small programs on computer felt like big accomplishments. As I went through more classes and studying on my own, I moved on from basic programs to making my first mobile gaming app. I learned App Inventor and then Java in High School. I tried to learn Python on my own by going through books I could find in the library. This passion followed me through college.

I have always been a fan of Formula 1 racing. I knew driving an F1 car is practically impossible but racing on go kart track wasn't, so I followed my passion and joined a Karting club when I was in high school. I participated in some of the races and won few trophies. This passion helped me a lot when I started working on my research of how F1 cars weight affect their overall speed (The link to the research paper is on Home page). Combining my passion of sports and computer science has helped me to a great extent in the journey of learning. I’m looking forward with great anticipation to the challenges that studying for a degree in computer science will bring.
